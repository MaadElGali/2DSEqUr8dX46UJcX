Project Title: Predicting Customers' Happiness

In this project, I looked at data that was collected via customer feedback survey aiming to gauge customers' satisfaction. 

The survey was conducted by a starup company in the realm of  logistics and delivery.

The goal of this project was to predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked.

I employed four ML models to achieve this goal: Logistics Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost

The highest accuracy score, 77%, was rendered by using the XGBoost Model.
